OpenDKIM-Fedora
===============
This git repo contains:

- **SPECS/opendkim.spec** - spec file for the OpenDKIM package I maintain in Fedora & EPEL (https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/opendkim/)

- **PATCHES** - patches for the spec file (as needed)

- **CONTRIB** - various files I maintain and contribute to the OpenDKIM upstream source

**NOTE:** As of 2.10.1-5, the systemd and SystemV versions of this spec file have been combined in the OpenDKIM-Fedora repo, and the OpenDKIM-SysV repo at http://github.com/stevejenkins/OpenDKIM-SysV/ has been abandonded.

**CONTRIBUTORS:** Please do pull requests in the "develop" branch only. The "master" branch is just for release versions. Thanks!
